Had a great weekend climbing. Both days were good. Frozen II was obviously the best movie i've ever seen. Maybe i've been looking for myself this whole time. RIP Olaf tho

11/22 (Frozen II) was - 10/10</br>
11/23 was - 9/10 overcame fear bouldering higher than ever</br>
11/24 was - 9/10 overcame great fear leading my first route outside, cleaning an anchor for the first time, climbing higher than ever and pushing myself harder than ever

11/25 Monday was probably - 6/10 pretty rough night but work was fine and KBBQ with the co-workers was good</br>
11/26 Yesterday was - 7/10 nothing really just work and watching rick n morto with the w00d bois</br>

Had a really nice thanksgiving dinner at Sugarfish. Little bit sad news but things seem okay for the most part. Great climbing, gym friends are good.

Today was - 8/10
