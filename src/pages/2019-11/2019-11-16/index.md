Feeling down :( but trying really hard not to. Lots of things to be thankful for; life isn't so bad today but i'm always tired, it feels bad, and everything is heavy. Still smiling a lot with friends but lacking motivation to talk.

Day so far at 4:51pm - 5/10

- [x] do 1 thing
- [x] wake up
- [x] coffee in the afternoon
- [x] smile or something
- [ ] meditate (its not too late for this, you can do it at night too, just do it)

Thought about Paul a lot yesterday. Specifially the hospital and Shanghai Knights. Feel like crying thinking about this again as I type it lol

Honestly wtf is wrong with me, its been like 13 years or something.
