October isn't a good month I guess. I'd like to start tracking things for these up coming winter months. Lets get this thing goin again.

- [ ] do 1 thing

You know what, lets try and get a coffee goin every morning and see how that feels.

- [ ] wake up
- [ ] coffee
- [ ] smile or something

Should we try n get some meditation goin again?

- [ ] meditate

This list is lookin okay. Not gonna be afraid to delete any of it tho if its gonna be comin at me hard. Not gonna be afraid of anything anymore tbh. Is pain really a bad thing? At the end of the day, pain is pleasure.
