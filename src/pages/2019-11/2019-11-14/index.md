I really forget my life so easily after i sleep. How can i forget about this whole thing after only just writing it. :sad:

How do you even make coffee tho?

- [x] do 1 thing
- [ ] wake up
- [ ] coffee in the morning before driving
- [x] smile or something
- [ ] meditate (its not too late for this, you can do it at night too, just do it)
