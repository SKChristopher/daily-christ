Its starting to feel really close to the ol birthday. Definitely didn't wake up today.

Mostly just auto pilot but bought some cool art finally which felt nice and looked into more work stuff that was a little bit more engaging. Really need to do my best to wake up tomorrow and try harder at work.

Made plans for the 12th which feels great and warm. ðŸ˜Œ

Day was - 7/10

- [x] do 1 thing - climb
- [ ] wake up
- [x] breakfast (save the chimps)
- [x] coffee in the afternoon
