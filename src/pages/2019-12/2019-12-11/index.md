ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ• Feelin pretty down today so far @ 2:30pm, thinking a lot about tomorrow... Really hoping this moon circle fixes my life. I think working from home was a poor choice with tomorrow lingering and all. Day ended really well, moon cirle was transformative AF 100% ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•

I have two brothers and they are both really cool :)

Day was - 10/10

- [x] do 1 thing (walked to lunch with friends)
- [x] wake up (8:30am)
- [ ] breakfast, need to go to the store; could have easily eaten breakfast
- [ ] coffee in the afternoon, probably would have been a great idea; fell asleep
- [x] smile or something
- [x] meditate (AF with the moon)
