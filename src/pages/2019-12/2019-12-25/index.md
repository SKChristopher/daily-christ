Had Erwhon breakfast yesterday and today, woke up both days. :) Having a good time skiing although pizzaing is impossible. Its really all about those sweet potato fries all the way down the mountain. Great Christmas time with Colin, Will, Shen-Shen, & Joanne. Don't remember the last time I had a family Christmas but this feels like one.

Had a wonderful day. Feeling sick but still a good time. What is my ideal life?
