Woke up to surf but the rain from yesterday detered us. Went to Great White for breakfast.

Did something at work, although small, still felt really good to do it and communicate with the team.

Great phone call after I got home :)

Short but great climbing session with a quick V6 flash.

Day was - 10/10

12/4 Yesterday was also a 10/10 day. Mediocre auto pilot workday but amazing night. :) Why is the world so cruel that it had to end?
