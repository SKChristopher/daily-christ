Hard to sleep but woke up feeling okay. Refreshing breakfast and morning so far. Really great morning and lunch at Cafe Gratitude. Good relaxing afternoon reading & chilling and great dinner at Shojin. I'm basically a vegan now.

Tried to do a lot of things on purpose for him but decided against most of them and just lived my own life.

My whole life is a poem now that you're in it ðŸŽ­
