morning: how do i do the back and forth? Its so difficult to be okay. I CAN DO THIS. 💪 Focus on the long game. Pain is temporary.

evening: or maybe its really easy? stop trying so hard. focus on others but stay grounded in yourself. win friends & influence tbh. i miss myself. closure? feeling great.
