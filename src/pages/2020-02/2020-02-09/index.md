these are the best of times, these are the worst of times

rainforest noises are sick af

actually laughed at least once

picked a place to eat for dinner (wow)

had an opportunity to create noise from my throat to be consumed in anothers ear

moments of darkness - eternities of light

touching the corona of truth

for better or for worse, never alone

connect 4

kinky (workin them out) - perhaps the life, perhaps not

this kind of stuff makes me feel more settled in my heart, you know?
