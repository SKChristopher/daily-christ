anybody can win

I better start thinking for myself rather than follow everybody. No one knows what they are doing. You don't need to fit in. Don't be afraid to stand out.

The real answer is to get to know yourself a little better - the mind

write down on a card exactly what you want and read it often

Adventure + Security = Success

- [x] wake up (6:40)
- [x] do 1 thing
- [ ] meditate
- [x] breakfast (Erewhon)
- [ ] caffeine in the afternoon

Self-care options:
- [x] smile or something
- [x] 10+ pull-ups
- [x] 30+ push-ups
- [x] chinese
- [x] walk
- [x] read
