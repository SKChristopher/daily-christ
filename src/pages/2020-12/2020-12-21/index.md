Feeling incredible this morning, extra social and high vibration energy. No jittering - no lingering tiredness. A little lighter than usual. It's nice.

It'd be nice to bring back the routine of practicing Chinese.

I could definitely see myself living in Hawaii or another tropical island someday. Surfing with no wetsuit is incredible and I love rainforests :)

Been consistently filling my rings for over a week now :)
