Why are people tryna block out the best color?

Feelin pretty close to getting a bed, really living my best life these days. Would be nice to get a mirror too, been tryna get one for a while really. Gonna be pretty poor after bed frame + mattress + bedding + mirror but if i put it on credit it's free right?

- [x] smile or something
- [ ] meditate
